        <p>Hoy Hoy! You all guys know me by Egitto, or if you are a new player, nice to meet you I'm Egitto.
        I'm a guy, who lives in The Netherlands, speak 4 different languages and (sometimes) love to play Minecraft.</p>
    
        <p>I am very passionate about HTML, I hate CSS so much >:(. 
        I wrote this site because I would really like to help the MinecraftOnline.com community and I 
        would like this site to be accessible to everyone and forever.</p>
        <p>Im about also to open a Forum (future update) on this website so that all the community can get in touch.</p>
        <p>For any more questions, you are free to send me an email (you can find the email address at the footer of this
        website).</p>
